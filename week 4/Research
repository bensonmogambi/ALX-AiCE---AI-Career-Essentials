How Chat GPT Works For Research
Last week, we discussed how ChatGPT works on the basis of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are trained using vast datasets of text from various sources. During the training process, the AI analyses and comprehends patterns in the data, enabling it to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. When you submit a query, ChatGPT utilizes its training to interpret the question and provide responses that are precise, while also mimicking the style of human language. This involves complex algorithms that predict the most probable response based on the input received.



It’s important to note that ChatGPT does not access or retrieve information from the internet in real-time. Instead, its responses are based on the knowledge it acquired during its training phase, which has a cut-off point after which it doesn’t receive updates.

So, what is the role of ChatGPT in research? Here are a few examples:

Data Gathering: ChatGPT can be an effective tool for gathering foundational data on a topic. For example, it can provide historical overviews, explain scientific concepts, or offer summaries of known theories and ideas. This capability is especially useful for the initial stages of research or when exploring new topics.
Summarization: ChatGPT excels in summarizing text, making it a valuable asset for digesting long articles, reports, or papers. By inputting text or highlighting key sections of a document, you can ask ChatGPT to provide concise summaries, which can save significant reading time.
Source Identification: While ChatGPT doesn’t directly fetch real-time data from external sources, it can guide you to potential types of sources or reference material that might be relevant to your research. For instance, it can suggest leading journals, key authors, or significant studies related to your topic of interest.
Drafting Research Queries: ChatGPT can also assist in formulating research queries or hypotheses. By providing a topic, you can ask ChatGPT to generate potential research questions or hypothesis statements, which can be refined for academic or professional research purposes.
