##AI Glossary
Phew! That was a lot of new terms and concepts. So, let’s put them all in one place so you can refer back to them at any point in this course.

AI terms you should know

✅ Artificial Intelligence (AI):

A subfield of computer science dedicated to creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes things like problem-solving, recognizing patterns, understanding language, and learning from experience.

✅ Algorithm:

A set of rules or instructions given to an AI program to help it make decisions or calculations. Think of it like a recipe for a computer.

✅ Machine Learning (ML):

A subset of AI where computers are trained to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

✅ Supervised Learning:

A type of machine learning where the AI system is trained on a labelled dataset, which means the data is already tagged with the correct answer.

✅ Unsupervised Learning:

Unlike supervised learning, this type involves training an AI system on data that is neither classified nor labelled, allowing the algorithm to act on the information without guidance.

✅ Reinforcement Learning:

A type of machine learning where an AI learns to make decisions by performing certain actions and assessing the rewards or penalties from those actions.

✅ Bias in AI:

Refers to when an AI system reflects inaccuracies, misrepresentation, or prejudices in the data it’s been trained on, potentially leading to erroneous, unfair, or discriminatory outcomes.

We’ve also added 5 advanced terms for you to look up yourself using AI. Open either <<https://chat.openai.com/>> or <<https://www.bing.com/?/ai>> and try asking AI what each of the terms below means:

🔍 Neural Network:

A computer system is designed to work by classifying information like a human brain does. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (like brain cells), which can learn and make intelligent decisions over time.

🔍 Deep Learning:

A complex subset of machine learning inspired by the structure of the human brain and involves neural networks with many layers (hence ‘deep’). It’s used for more complex tasks like speech recognition or image analysis.

🔍 Natural Language Processing (NLP):

The ability of computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a meaningful and useful way.

🔍 Data Mining:

The process of analysing large data sets to discover patterns, correlations, and trends. It’s like being a detective but for data!

🔍 Computer Vision:

The field of AI trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world, enabling machines to identify objects, scenes, and activities in images or video.
