The history of AI starts well before the advent of Chat GPT. In fact, it begins in the 1950s with Alan Turing, who lays the foundation for testing machine intelligence. Here are some key periods of AI’s history that shed more light on all the advancements that have brought AI to our fingertips today.

1950s - The Beginning

1950: Alan Turing proposes the Turing Test to measure a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour.

1956: The term “Artificial Intelligence” was coined by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference, marking the official birth of the field.

1960s - Early Enthusiasm

1961: The first industrial robot, Unimate, started working on assembly lines in a General Motors factory.

1966: ELIZA, an early natural language processing computer program, is created to simulate conversation.

1970s - AI Winter Begins

1974-1980: The first AI Winter, a period of reduced funding and interest in AI research due to disillusionment with the progress and capabilities of AI.

1980s - A Renewed Hope

1980: The rise of Expert Systems, computer programs that emulate a human expert’s decision-making ability, rekindled interest in AI.

1987-1993: The second AI Winter was caused by the collapse of the market for Lisp machines and disappointment in expert systems.

1990s - The Internet and Increased Computing Power

1997: IBM’s Deep Blue defeats world chess champion Garry Kasparov.

Late 1990s: The emergence of the Internet leads to increased data availability, a crucial factor for AI research and development.

2000s - Advancements in Machine Learning

2006: The term “Deep Learning” is introduced, referring to deep artificial neural networks.

2009: Google starts developing self-driving cars.

2010s - AI starts Becoming Mainstream:

2011: IBM’s Watson wins Jeopardy!, a popular American TV quiz show.

2014: Chatbots become more sophisticated, with systems like Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa.

2016: Google’s AlphaGo defeats world champion Go player, a significant milestone in AI for a game considered far more complex than chess.

2018: Beautiful.AI Launches the First AI-Powered Presentation Design Tool

2020s - AI in Everyday Life

2021: AI are integrated into increasingly diverse fields, such as healthcare for drug discovery, finance for fraud detection, and in everyday applications like smartphones and smart homes.

2022: Chat GPT-3 and MidJourney made available to the general public.

2023: Chat GPT-4 is made available to the public. It is more creative and can generate, edit, and iterate with users on technical and creative writing tasks. 35% of companies were using AI in 2023, with the highest adoption rates in financial services, healthcare, retail, and manufacturing.

Entering 2024: AI continues to evolve, with ongoing research in ethical AI, explainable AI, and advancements in natural language processing, scientific research, and generative AI models.

Some AI products to watch in 2024 include:

Notion, OpenAI, Theneo, LongShot AI, GoCharlie.ai, and DreamStudio.
